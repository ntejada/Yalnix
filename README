CHECKPOINT 7:

We have finished implementing our additional features as well as more thoroughly testing our OS. Some new files include:

copy.* - we have moved our CoW functions and our copying of the stack and region 1 from our init program to these new files.

sem.* - this file contains our sem implementation 

Some explanation to our additional features:

We have implemented CoW, a PS syscall, semaphoares, and a Spoon method for keeping global data shared across all forked processes. We believe CoW is fully working, and you will be able to follow its implementation in copy.c, trap.c (Trap Memory), and switch.c. Our PS syscall can be called in user programs using the PS() command. Like most OS's, we keep track of zombie processes until the parents calls wait on them. The DoPS() function can be found in proc.c, but keeping track of the current processes is scattered throughout our code although most of it can be found in DoFork, DoExit, DoWait, and KillProc. Our semaphores can be found in sem.c, and this implementation should be pretty straightforward. Functions using semaphores include, SemInit, SemUp, SemDown, and Reclaim. This spoon method can be found in copy.c, proc.c and switch.c. The only difference between this and fork is setting the global data to have protections of read and write. Because CoW shares pages that are global data, we don't need to do anything else other than change these protections and store the location of the global data into the PCB while executing LoadProg. 

We have encountered some strangeness in our Spoon method. Processes can access global data and update shared variables.  But when using TtyPrint, the strings stored in global data somehow are interfering with global data in weird ways, causing erratic print behavior. Odd characters pop up on the terminals as well as some print statements are executing twice on multiple terminals. When using TtyTransmit, however, no such behavior is witnessed. 

We recommend running with lk initially set to 1. As you increase this number, there will be more TracePrints, as we have tried to provide helpful debugging print statements as higher levels of lk. Increasing this number could also give you a better idea of what functions are being called and when those functions are called.

**************************************************************

CHECKPOINT 6:

We have implemented pipes, cvars, and locks effectively.

New Programs:

pipe.* - contains all syscalls that corresond to a pipe

cvar.* - contains all syscalls related to a cvar

lock.* - contains all syscalls related to a lock

resource.* - this is the overarching file that helps to manage locks, cvars, and pipes. In order to make reclaim work, every lock, pipe, or cvar id is a certain modulus of 3. So to determine what type of sync primitive or pipe the user wants to reclaim, we mod the ID by 3, and then reclaim the corresponding resource. We also have a resource struct that allows us to search our queues of locks, cvars, and pipes to find the resource corresponding to the id.  This allows us to search the queues without having to cast to specific resources in each different case, thereby reducing the amount of repeated code. 

CoW is working after changing our trap memory, but we still need to stress test it. We will be implementing a ps call, semaphores, and probably shared memory to execute the bridge problem. 

Would it be sufficient to make global data in region 1 a shared memory location for all forked processes? This way they all can access the cars on bridge count and all see each others modifications? We believe this would work, but don't know if you wanted a more sophisticated manner of allocated shared memory rather than just making all global memory shared for this problem. 

***************************************************************

CHECKPOINT 5:

We believe we have essentially implemented TtyRead and TtyWrite. 

Also, we are wondering what implementation we should choose when reading from a new line. Say we enter 0123456789\n into the terminal, TtyReceive copies the string as well as the new line character and copies it into memory. Then say the user wants to read 10 chars, the next reader will read in an extra new line character. Should we code against this or keep this implementation? We are currently coding against this but we can change the implementation. 

New Programs:

tty.* - contains InitTTY, DoTtyRead, DoTtyWrite, ReadFromBuffer. We created a struct TTY for each terminal containing read and write blocked queues for that terminal, a queue for overflow structs after a read operation that leaves characters, and other buffer pointers for execution. 

proc.* - this contains the TtyRecieveHandler and TtyTransmitHandler.

We are still working on CoW, but realized this would become more complicated after implementing TtyRead and TtyWrite, so we have yet to refactor it for the new operations specified. 



*****************************************************************

CHECKPOINT 4:

We successfully completed this checkpoint as well, getting Exit, Fork, Exec all to Work. We had a little difficulty forking at first but this turned out to be from not flushing the correct part of the PCB.

***New User Programs***
forkExecTest - tests out exec with a forked child (it execs exit56)  and has the parent delay and then wait on the child which tests also the handling of Zombie processes.
forkTest - tests out multiple forking 

We are looking to implement CoW as well but have not been able to fully flesh it out for this checkpoint.

******************************************************************

CHECKPOINT 3:

We successfully completed this checkpoint. We had to heavily modify our KernelStart function since we could not successfully call LoadProgram twice within the same process. Because we only have one running process besides our idle process, we could not rigorously test Delay and Brk, but both of these calls seemed to work when we tested them with init. 

frames.* - holds functions to keep track of available frames in physical memory. getNextFrame, initFrameList, and addFrame. 

switch.* - contains info for context switching. FirstSwitch places a valid kernel context into both the init and idle processes. MyKCS handles context switching between two processes where at least one already has a valid kernel context.

loadProg.* - program to create usercontext for a process

delay.* - contains functions to update a delayed blocked queue and place those processes back on the ready queue after there have been the specified number of clock ticks

init.* - modifications made to KernelStart and creation of functions copyStack and copyPages

initIdle.c / initInit.c - Idle and Init processes to run in KernelStart

trap.* - modifications made to Clock Handler: Context switches to a new process every clock tick and also updates the processes that called delay. 

proc.* - holds info the PCB struct and function to create PCB. DoBrk executes Brk call from a user process calling malloc. DoDelay places process that called delay onto delay_queue and context switches to a ready process. LoadNextProc removes any processes from the delay queue that are ready to execute and then pops of next process from ready queue to be executed, then performing a context switch. DoGetPid retrieves PID of current running process.

***User Programs***

initIdle - our idle process

initInit - tests our delay syscall

brkTest - tests our brk syscall and getPid
